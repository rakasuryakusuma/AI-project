# THIS IS THE MIMICK OF NUMPY
# WELCOME TO DUMPY
Hello, my name is **Dionisius Raka Surya Kusuma** from IUP Ai and Big Data Analytics 23.K4.0003
in this module, I try to mimick numpy but not precisely the same. I'm focusing to do operation between object and also inheritance implementation

## How to run it! 
1. Make sure you already download the file and have 2 file name **main.py** and **dumpy.py**
2. You need to open the terminal and then type:
``` python main.py ```
or ``` py main.py ```

3. **Then Press Enter**

# DISCLAIMER
## To be honest this module still have one error that I don't know why, I already put the correct code and also the correct matrix shape but it still produce an error that say:
    raise ValueError("Determinant calculation is only for 2x2 and 3x3 matrix")
_ValueError: Determinant calculation is only for 2x2 and 3x3 matrix_

It also have the same problem with the inverse operation.

# NOTE! IF YOU CAN'T RUN THE CODE
Please make sure you only have **1** (one) file with name main.py in the folder.
